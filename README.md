## 📊 Key Metrics for Analysis  

### 1️⃣ **Customer Churn Analysis**  
- **Churn Rate** = (Total Churned Customers / Total Customers) * 100  
- **Churn by Contract Type** = Number of churned customers per contract type  
- **Churn by Internet Service** = Churn rate for DSL, Fiber Optic, etc.  
- **Churn by Payment Method** = Which payment methods have the highest churn?  

### 2️⃣ **Revenue & Financial Metrics**  
- **Average Monthly Revenue** = Mean of Monthly Charges  
- **Total Revenue by Contract Type** = Sum of Total Charges grouped by contract  
- **High-Value Customers** = Customers with high TotalCharges and long tenure  

### 3️⃣ **Service Usage & Customer Segmentation**  
- **Average Tenure by Contract Type** = How long do customers stay based on contract?  
- **Most Common Internet Service** = Count of each InternetService type  
- **Streaming Service Adoption** = Percentage of customers using StreamingTV or StreamingMovies  

### 4️⃣ **Customer Support & Technical Issues**  
- **Number of Support Tickets (numTechTickets, numAdminTickets)** = Average number per customer  
- **Support Tickets vs. Churn** = Do more tickets lead to churn?  

### 5️⃣ **Payment & Billing Insights**  
- **Preferred Payment Methods** = Count of customers per PaymentMethod  
- **Paperless Billing Impact** = Does PaperlessBilling lead to higher churn?  

## 📊 Customer Retention Insights  
The analysis uncovered several key trends affecting **customer retention**. **Demographics** played a role, with **senior citizens exhibiting lower retention rates**, while **customers with dependents showed higher retention**. **Tenure and subscription type** significantly influenced churn, as **churn was highest in the first 20 months**, particularly among **month-to-month contract holders (42.7%)**, while **two-year contracts had the highest retention (97.2%)**. **Billing and payment patterns** also impacted retention, with customers on **higher monthly charges churning more frequently**, whereas those using **auto-pay methods** (bank transfer, credit card) showed better retention, while **electronic check users had higher churn rates**. Additionally, **customer support interactions played a key role**, as customers who received **effective support showed higher retention**, whereas unresolved technical issues correlated with increased churn. These insights highlight the need for **targeted interventions to improve customer experience and enhance long-term retention**.
