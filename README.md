# **Customer Retention Analysis**

## **Overview**  
The Customer Retention Analysis project focuses on identifying key factors influencing customer retention and churn. By leveraging data-driven insights, the analysis helps businesses enhance customer satisfaction, improve service offerings, and implement proactive retention strategies. The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, billing details, and support interactions, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior.

## **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset consists of the following key attributes:

- **Customer Demographics:** Gender, Senior Citizen status, Dependents.  
- **Tenure & Subscription:** Tenure duration, contract type, and subscription details.  
- **Service Usage Metrics:** Usage of phone, internet, multiple lines, security services, and entertainment services.  
- **Billing & Payment Metrics:** Monthly charges, total charges, and payment methods.  
- **Customer Support Tickets:** Number and type of support interactions.  

## **Project Goals**  
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights into customer retention by identifying trends in churn behavior and factors affecting customer loyalty. These insights help businesses develop targeted strategies to enhance customer experience and increase retention rates.

## **Analysis Summary**  
The analysis examines key factors influencing customer retention, including demographics, tenure, service usage, billing, and support interactions. Senior citizens and customers without dependents show lower retention rates, while long-term contracts have higher retention compared to month-to-month plans. Short-tenure customers (0–20 months) are more likely to leave, indicating early dissatisfaction. Core services such as phone and internet, especially Fiber Optic, impact retention, while security and tech support services contribute to customer loyalty. Higher monthly charges and electronic check payments correlate with lower retention, while frequent customer support interactions, especially unresolved technical issues, lead to dissatisfaction. Understanding these trends enables businesses to develop retention strategies such as contract incentives, better support services, and proactive engagement.
